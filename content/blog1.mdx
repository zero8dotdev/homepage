Building a multi-user app is like hosting a party: you want everyone to have fun, but you *also* need to stop that one guest from spilling drinks on the server. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is your bouncer, ensuring users only access what they're allowed to. In this guide, you'll learn how to implement RBAC in Supabase like a pro—with zero fluff, real-world examples, and battle-tested best practices. Let's dive in.

---

### **Why RBAC? (Spoiler: It's Not Just About Security)**

RBAC isn't just a security checkbox. It's about **scalability**, **auditability**, and **sanity**. Here's why:

1. **Security**: Prevent unauthorized deletions, edits, or data leaks.
2. **Compliance**: Meet GDPR, HIPAA, or SOC2 requirements by design.
3. **Scalability**: Manage 10 users or 10,000 without losing sleep.
4. **Clean Code**: Avoid spaghetti logic like `if (user.isAdmin) { ... }` scattered across your app.

Without RBAC, you're playing whack-a-mole with permissions. With it, you're building a fortress.

### **How RBAC Works in Supabase: The Big Picture**

Supabase combines three PostgreSQL superpowers for RBAC:

1. **Database Roles**: Define roles (e.g., `admin`, `editor`).
2. **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Restrict access at the row level.
3. **JWTs with Custom Claims**: Embed user roles in auth tokens.

Here's the workflow:

1. Assign a role to a user.
2. Store that role in their JWT during authentication.
3. Use RLS policies to restrict database access based on the role.

Let's build this step by step.

### **Step 1: Define Roles and Permissions (The Foundation)**

Start by answering: *What can users DO in your app?* For a project management app:

- `projects.create`
- `projects.delete`
- `tasks.assign`

Map these permissions to roles:

```
Admin: projects.delete, tasks.assign
Manager: projects.create, tasks.assign
Member: projects.create

```

**Implementing this in Supabase:**

1. **Create Enums** for clean type-checking:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TYPE app_permission AS ENUM (
      'projects.create',
      'projects.delete',
      'tasks.assign'
    );
    CREATE TYPE app_role AS ENUM ('admin', 'manager', 'member');
    
    ```
    
2. **Link Roles to Permissions**:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE role_permissions (
      role app_role NOT NULL,
      permission app_permission NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY (role, permission)
    );
    
    -- Assign permissions
    INSERT INTO role_permissions (role, permission)
    VALUES
      ('admin', 'projects.delete'),
      ('admin', 'tasks.assign'),
      ('manager', 'projects.create'),
      ('manager', 'tasks.assign'),
      ('member', 'projects.create');
    
    ```
    

---

### **Step 2: Assign Roles to Users (Without Headaches)**

Use a `user_roles` table to link users to their roles. **Pro tip**: Always reference `auth.users` to cascade deletes automatically:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_roles (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role app_role NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role)
);

-- Make user_id='abc' an admin
INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('abc', 'admin');

```

**Why this works**:

- `ON DELETE CASCADE` ensures roles vanish if a user is deleted.
- Primary key `(user_id, role)` prevents duplicate role assignments.

---

### **Step 3: Embed Roles in JWTs (The Secret Sauce)**

Supabase issues JWTs during authentication. We'll modify these tokens to include the user's role using a **PostgreSQL trigger**:

1. **Create a Trigger Function**:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.set_custom_claims()
    RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
    DECLARE
      user_role app_role;
    BEGIN
      -- Fetch the user's role
      SELECT role INTO user_role
      FROM user_roles
      WHERE user_id = NEW.id;
    
      -- Update the JWT
      NEW.raw_app_meta_data = jsonb_set(
        NEW.raw_app_meta_data,
        '{role}',
        to_jsonb(user_role)
      );
      RETURN NEW;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
    
    ```
    
2. **Attach the Trigger to Auth Users**:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
    AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION public.set_custom_claims();
    
    ```
    

Now, every user's JWT includes their role:

```json
{
  "sub": "abc123",
  "role": "admin",
  ...
}

```

### **Step 4: Enforce Permissions with RLS (The Gatekeeper)**

Row-Level Security (RLS) is where the magic happens. Let's lock down the `projects` table:

1. **Enable RLS**:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
    
    ```
    
2. **Create Helper Functions**:
    
    ```sql
    -- Check if a user has a specific permission
    CREATE FUNCTION has_permission(permission app_permission)
    RETURNS boolean
    LANGUAGE plpgsql
    SECURITY DEFINER
    AS $$
    DECLARE
      user_role app_role;
    BEGIN
      user_role := (auth.jwt() ->> 'role')::app_role;
      RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM role_permissions
        WHERE
          role = user_role AND
          permission = has_permission.permission
      );
    END;
    $$;
    
    ```
    
3. **Create RLS Policies**:
    
    ```sql
    -- Admins can delete any project
    CREATE POLICY admin_delete_policy ON projects
    FOR DELETE USING (has_permission('projects.delete'));
    
    -- Managers/members can create projects
    CREATE POLICY create_project_policy ON projects
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (has_permission('projects.create'));
    
    ```
    

**Key Takeaways**:

- `WITH CHECK` validates new rows.
- `USING` filters existing rows.
- `has_permission()` centralizes your logic.

### **Step 5: Frontend Integration (UX Matters)**

Don't show delete buttons to users who can't delete. Use the JWT role to tailor the UI:

```jsx
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { jwtDecode } from 'jwt-decode';

const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);

// Fetch role on login
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
const { role } = jwtDecode(user.access_token);

// Conditionally render UI
{role === 'admin' && (
  <button onClick={deleteProject}>Delete Project</button>
)}

```

---

### **Advanced Tactics for Production-Grade RBAC**

1. **Hierarchical Roles**:
    
    Let roles inherit permissions (e.g., `admin` > `manager` > `member`). Use recursive SQL queries:
    
    ```sql
    WITH RECURSIVE role_tree AS (
      SELECT role, permission
      FROM role_permissions
      WHERE role = 'admin'
      UNION ALL
      SELECT rp.role, rp.permission
      FROM role_permissions rp
      JOIN role_tree rt ON rp.role = rt.role
    )
    SELECT * FROM role_tree;
    
    ```
    
2. **Time-Bounded Roles**:
    
    Assign temporary roles (e.g., "trial_editor" for 7 days) with `user_roles.expires_at` column.
    
3. **Audit Logs**:
    
    Track role changes with a `role_audit` table:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE role_audit (
      user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users,
      old_role app_role,
      new_role app_role,
      changed_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
    );
    
    ```

### **Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)**

1. **Shadow Admins**:
    - **Risk**: Users might have multiple roles (e.g., `admin` and `editor`).
    - **Fix**: Use `SELECT DISTINCT` in JWT hooks to prioritize roles.
2. **RLS Bypass**:
    - **Risk**: Forgetting RLS on a table.
    - **Fix**: Double-check with:
        
        ```sql
        SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
        
        ```
        
3. **JWT Size Bloat**:
    - **Risk**: Storing too much data in JWTs.
    - **Fix**: Only include essential claims (e.g., `role`).

### **Testing Your RBAC: The Forgotten Step**

1. **Unit Tests for Policies**:
    
    Use `pgTAP` to automate policy testing:
    
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT plan(1);
    SET ROLE test_member;
    SELECT ok(
      NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM projects WHERE id = 1),
      'Members cannot delete projects'
    );
    SELECT * FROM finish();
    ROLLBACK;
    
    ```
    
2. **Frontend Integration Tests**:
    
    Mock JWTs with different roles using Cypress:
    
    ```jsx
    cy.login('admin'); // Sets admin JWT
    cy.get('#delete-button').should('exist');
    
    ```

### **Wrapping Up: Your RBAC Checklist**

1. ✅ Define roles and permissions with enums.
2. ✅ Assign roles via `user_roles`.
3. ✅ Embed roles in JWTs using triggers.
4. ✅ Lock down tables with RLS policies.
