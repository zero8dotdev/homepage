# Hello World

This is my **first** blog post written in MDX. It’s a *fantastic* way to combine Markdown with JSX, letting me write ~~boring~~ *exciting* content with ease.

## Introduction

Welcome to my blog! Here, I’ll cover everything from coding to yoga, with a mix of technical details and personal insights. Here’s a picture of my coding setup:

### Why MDX?

MDX is great because it blends Markdown’s simplicity with React’s power. For example, here’s a TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
